# Python Learning

This repository contains the code from a series of problems and exercises I've completed while learning Python in spring 2020. The exercises are meant to build reps with fundamental programming concepts. Many of them can be found at this link: https://www.practicepython.org/

The exercises were all completed in Jupyter Notebooks and are .ipynb files.
